            <h5>Storage Duration of User-Submitted Data for AI Analysis:</h5>
            <p>User-submitted data for AI analysis is stored temporarily to enable AI model processing, analysis, or transformation. Retention periods vary by processing mode:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard Processing:</strong> Data is retained no longer than 72 hours after processing is complete</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Processing (Streaming Mode):</strong> Data is not stored at all beyond active memory</li>
                <li><strong>Batch Processing Jobs:</strong> Data may be retained for up to 7 days, but only with the client’s explicit written consent for staged or multi-pass processing</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Storage Location of User-Submitted Data for AI Analysis:</h5>
            <p>All data is stored on secure, access-controlled cloud servers (such as AWS and Azure) that are compliant with HIPAA and GDPR requirements. All data at rest is encrypted using AES-256. Data in transit uses TLS 1.2+ encryption. All data access events are logged and monitored, and only authorized personnel under a signed non-disclosure agreement have access to data. Data used for QA or debugging (if applicable) is obfuscated and anonymized before use.</p>

            <h5>Deletion Protocol:</h5>
            <p>Data is automatically deleted upon completion of the analysis cycle or after the defined retention period. Clients may request immediate deletion of submitted data at any time via a support ticket, contacting <a href="mailto:info@subjectsofalquran.com">info@subjectsofalquran.com</a>, or API command. Temporary user-submitted data is not included in long-term backups. Any residual metadata is anonymized and purged on a rolling basis.</p>

            <h5>Storage and Deletion Exceptions:</h5>
            <p>If users opt in to allow storage for training or audit purposes, such data will be de-identified or pseudonymized, stored separately, and governed by a separate consent and license agreement.</p>

            <p>When we no longer have a legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. We utilize end-to-end encryption, role-based access control, and regular vulnerability assessments and audits. PII and PHI are only accessed when necessary for defined purposes, and only the minimum necessary data is processed per task. Whenever possible, data is de-identified or pseudonymized. For PHI, we utilize a HIPAA compliance cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS HealthLake, Azure Health Data Services).</p>
            <p>However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.</p>
