  <h4 class="bg py-2 text-white px-2 rounded-3">II. COOKIE MANAGEMENT</h4>
  <p>Depending on where you live, you may be able to adjust your Cookie preferences at any time via the “Cookie Settings” link in the footer of relevant websites. You can also use the following methods to manage Cookies. In order to do so, you must take such steps on each browser or device that you use. If you replace, change, or upgrade your browser or device, or if you delete your Cookies, you may need to use these opt-out tools again. As some Cookie-management solutions also rely on Cookies, please adjust your browser Cookie settings carefully, following the relevant instructions below.</p>

  <h5 class="text-dark">Browser Controls:</h5>
  <p>You may be able to disable and manage some Cookies through your browser settings. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to manage your settings for each. Please click on any of the browser links below for instructions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
    <li>Apple Safari</li>
    <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the browser you use is not listed above, please refer to your browser’s help menu for information on how to manage Cookies. Please be aware that disabling cookies will not disable other analytics tools we may use to collect information about you or your use of our Services.</p>

  <h5 class="text-dark">Analytics Provider Opt-Outs:</h5>
  <p>To disable analytics Cookies, you may use the browser controls discussed above, or for some of our providers, you may use their individual opt-out mechanisms:</p>

  <h5 class="text-dark">Flash Local Storage:</h5>
  <p>These Cookies are also known as local shared objects and may be used to store your preferences or display content by us, advertisers, and other third parties. Flash Cookies need to be deleted in the storage section of your Flash Player Settings Manager.</p>

  <h5 class="text-dark">Interest-Based Advertising:</h5>
  <p>Most third-party advertisers offer a way to opt-out of their interest-based advertising. For more information or to opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising from participating third-party advertisers, depending on your country of residence, please visit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Digital Advertising Alliance in the US</li>
    <li>European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</li>
    <li>Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can also opt-out of some of the advertising providers we use by visiting their opt-out pages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google’s <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> • <a href="#">Opt-Out page</a></li>
    <li>Facebook’s <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> • <a href="#">Opt-Out Page</a></li>
    <li>X’s <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> • <a href="#">Opt-Out Page</a></li>
    <li>Snapchat’s <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> • <a href="#">Opt-Out Page</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are examples of our advertising providers, and this is not an exhaustive list. In addition, we are not responsible for the effectiveness of any advertising provider’s opt-out mechanisms.</p>
  <p>After you opt out, you will still see advertisements, but they may not be as relevant to you.</p>

  <h5 class="text-dark">Mobile Settings:</h5>
  <p>You may manage the collection of information for interest-based advertising purposes in mobile apps via the device’s settings, including managing the collection of location data. To opt out of mobile ad tracking from Nielsen or other third parties, you can do so by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt-out of Ads Personalization” (for Android devices) options in your device settings.</p>

  <h5 class="text-dark">Connected Devices:</h5>
  <p>For connected devices, such as smart TVs or streaming devices, you should review the device’s settings and select the option that allows you to disable automatic content recognition or ad tracking. Typically, to opt out, such devices require you to select options like “limit ad tracking” or to disable options such as “interest-based advertising,” “interactive TV,” or “smart interactivity”. These settings vary by device type.</p>

  <h5 class="text-dark">Cross-Device Tracking:</h5>
  <p>If you would like to opt out of our browser-based cross-device tracking for advertising purposes, you may do so by using the various methods described above. You must opt out separately on each device and each browser that you use. For more information about cross-device matching, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative, or the Digital Advertising Alliance. If you opt out of cross-device tracking for advertising purposes, we may still conduct cross-device tracking for essential purposes such as security, fraud prevention, and analytics. This tracking will be limited to what is necessary for the proper functioning of our Services.</p>

  <h5 class="text-dark">Consequences of Deactivation of all Cookies:</h5>
  <p>If you disable or remove Cookies, some parts of the Services may not function properly. Even if you disable cookies, we may collect and use certain essential information required for the basic functioning of our Services, such as maintaining your opt-out preferences, ensuring security, and providing core service features. Any such collection will be limited to what is strictly necessary.</p>
