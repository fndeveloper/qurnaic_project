  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Women have played an integral role in shaping societies, cultures, and civilizations throughout history. From ancient queens to modern activists, their contributions continue to influence every aspect of life.</p>

  <h3>About The Company</h3>
  <p>The Fons Vitae Publications, Inc. is a publishing house. We publish book, e-books, business books, science books, university students' research papers & journals and many other self help books.</p>

  <h3>The Project</h3>
  <p>This website is a research-based initiative titled "The Subjects of Al-Quran Al-Hakeem." Our goal is to provide user-friendly tools for searching, studying, reading, listening to, and exploring the Holy Quran in as many languages as possible. After an extensive research effort spanning from 2001 to 2025, we have identified and categorized more than 4,000 distinct subjects mentioned in the Holy Quran. These subjects cover a wide range of dimensions, including words, subjects, context, ideas, concepts, perception, and themes related to the past, present, and future. Our research delves into various aspects of life — Individual, Collective, History, Arts, Culture, Economic, Political, Social, and Spiritual — to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Holy Quran's guidance and relevance across times and cultures.</p>

  <h3>About Allah</h3>
  <p>Allah/God/Khuda/Malik/Rab is the only One who created from nothingness to everything that Is, and Is Not. Allah has introduced itself in the The Holy Quran as Alhamdolillah Rabul Aalameen, All praise be to the Nurturer of the Universe; and also as Malik-e-Yom Al-Deen (pronounced as Ad'Deen) The King of the Day of determination of Paths, and in many other ways that we will discover in the Subjects of Al-Quran Al-Hakeem.</p>

  <h3>About Mohammad PBUH</h3>
  <p>The Venerable, the holiest of holies, the one who's ranks are above and beyond, the first addressee of the Holy Quran. The Holy Prophet Mohammad peace be upon him is one the Messengers of Allah from Adam (PBUH) to Mohammad (PBUH) he is the last one, he is the Seal of the Prophet-hood. Allah has introduced Mohammad PBUH as Wama Arsalnaka Illa Rehmatullil Aalameen, "We have not sent you but as the Blessing (Rehmat) for the entire Universe". We will discover in detail how Allah has highlighted his qualities and attributes and mentioned about the Prophet Mohammad PBUH in the Holy Quran.</p>

  <h3>About the Holy Quran</h3>
  <p>Al-Quran Al-Hakeem (The Holy Quran the book of wisdom) is one of the Holy Books by the Almighty all Benevolent Allah. The Holy Quran is the completion of Deen/path that began since the arrival of human being on the planet earth and the Life of Adam (Peace be upon him) on Earth. The continuity of the revelations upon different Prophets over the period of time ends at the Holy Quran. This 'The Holy Quran' is the book that was revealed or poured down by the chosen Angels of Allah upon the heart (chest) of the last Prophet Mohammad (Peace be upon him). 'The Holy Quran' contains approximately 77,439 words in the original Arabic text. It has 114 Chapter (Surah) and 6236 Ayah (verses).</p>
