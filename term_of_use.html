      Registered Users must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in the Registered User’s jurisdiction, if greater) to create and maintain an account. By registering, a Registered User represents and warrants that the Registered User meets this requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Company reserves the right to refuse or cancel any registration at its sole discretion, including but not limited to situations where the provided information is incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent. Registered Users agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to keep such information up to date.

    </li>
    <li>
      We may offer both personal and professional/team accounts. In the event personal accounts are offered, personal accounts are intended solely for individual use and may not be shared with others. In the event professional or team accounts are offered (which are designed for use by businesses, organizations, or groups), such accounts must be created and managed by an authorized representative of the entity.

Each individual user within a professional or team account must have unique login credentials. Sharing of credentials is strictly prohibited.

      Registered Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of the Registered User’s account credentials (including usernames, passwords, or other access controls) and for all activities that occur under a Registered User’s account, whether or not authorized by the Registered User. Therefore, Registered Users shall take all steps necessary to ensure that others do not gain access to the Registered Users’ account and/or password. In addition, Registered Users may not use their account to breach the security of another account or attempt to gain unauthorized access to another network or server. Registered Users shall adopt adequate security measures to prevent or minimize unauthorized use of their account. Registered Users shall immediately notify the Company upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of their account and/or password. The Company shall cooperate fully with investigations of violations of systems or network security at other sites, including cooperating with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of suspected criminal violations. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from Registered Users’ failure to comply with these obligations.

  <p>The Company respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “Act”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.</p>

  <p>By accessing the Services, the Company grants you a limited revocable non-exclusive license to its Services. The Company, under the Act, reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate your license to use the Services if it determines in its sole and absolute discretion that you are involved in infringing activity, including alleged acts of first-time or repeat infringement, regardless of whether the material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in compliance with the Act, if you believe that any such third-party materials infringe your intellectual property rights, please send a notice to the agent identified below to request a review of the alleged infringement. The notice must include the following information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(a) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
    <li>(b) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or, if multiple copyrighted works located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);</li>
    <li>(c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow the Company to locate the material on the Services;</li>
    <li>(d) The name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party;</li>
    <li>(e) A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
    <li>(f) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send the Company a counter-notice.</p>

  <p>Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright" target="_blank">http://www.loc.gov/copyright</a> for details.</p>

  <p>Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services should be sent to:</p>

  <h4 class="bg py-2 text-white px-2 rounded-3">XVIII. ARBITRATION</h4>

  <p><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES</strong></p>
  <p>We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient, and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. Therefore, under these Terms of Use, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding or relating to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>your use of or interaction with the Services;</li>
    <li>any purchases or other transactions or relationships with the Company;</li>
    <li>any data or information you may provide to the Company or that the Company may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction;</li>
    <li>any other unresolved claim or controversy (collectively, “Company Transactions or Relationships”);</li>
  </ul>

  <p>you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or arbitration. By using or interacting with the Services or engaging in any other Company Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.</p>

  <p>Our rights and obligations under this arbitration provision shall inure to the benefit of each of the Company’s parent company(ies) and/or owners, regardless of whether any of them are named as a co-defendant or individually in a claim.</p>

  <p><strong>Before arbitration:</strong> We will attempt to resolve disputes informally for at least 30 days. If not resolved, you agree that any claim or controversy will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Applicable Rules”).</p>

  <p>You consent to the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules where applicable. You acknowledge that you’ve read and understand the Applicable Rules or waive the opportunity to challenge them.</p>

  <p><strong>Batch Arbitration:</strong> If 25+ similar claims are filed, they may be administered in batches of 25. Each batch will be treated as a single arbitration with one arbitrator, one fee per side, one hearing (if any), and one award.</p>

  <p><strong>You further agree that:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Arbitration will be before a single arbitrator under the Applicable Rules or mutual agreement;</li>
    <li>The Arbitrator (not any court) has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the arbitration provision itself, including enforceability;</li>
    <li>Arbitration hearings will be held in Florida (or documents only for claims under $10,000 unless a hearing is requested);</li>
    <li>The Arbitrator will apply Florida law or federal law, honor legal privileges, and may rule on motions like dismissal or summary judgment;</li>
    <li>The Arbitrator shall issue a detailed written award (“Award”), which may be enforced in court;</li>
    <li>If any part of this arbitration provision is found unenforceable, the rest shall remain in effect (severability);</li>
    <li>You or we may seek emergency equitable relief in court, pending arbitration outcome;</li>
    <li>This arbitration agreement will survive termination of these Terms or your use of our Services.</li>
